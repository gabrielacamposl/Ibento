## üì± Real Device Testing (Recommended)

### Before Production Deploy
1. **Test on actual Android device**
   - Install Chrome Beta/Canary for latest PWA features
   - Test install flow
   - Test push notifications
   - Test offline functionality

2. **Test on actual iOS device**
   - Use Safari for testing
   - Test "Add to Home Screen"
   - Test web app capabilities
   - Verify icon and splash screen

## ‚ö° Performance Checks
- [ ] **Lighthouse PWA score** - Should be 90+ 
- [ ] **Core Web Vitals** - Good scores
- [ ] **Bundle size** - Reasonable for mobile
- [ ] **Cache efficiency** - Fast subsequent loads

## üî• Firebase Console Verification
1. **Check Firebase Console**
   - [ ] Project settings match .env

3. **Manifest file missing** - Created comprehensive manifest
4. **iOS meta tags** - Added all required tags
5. **Service Worker registration conflicts** - Centralized registration

### Testing Notes
- Use Chrome DevTools Application tab to inspect PWA features
- Use DevTools Network tab to verify caching strategies
- Test offline mode by throttling network
- Use Firebase Console to send test notifications
- Test installation prompt by clearing browser data
